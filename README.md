## ML and DL Projects on Real-World Datasets

This repository contains three small but powerful projects where machine learning and deep learning techniques are used to analyze real-world datasets. Each project includes clear visualizations, model building, and performance comparison using Python.

Whether you're just starting out or revising ML concepts, this repo has something useful.

## Project Overviews

### 1. Seeds Clustering (`seeds_clustering/`)
- **Goal:** Group different types of wheat seeds using clustering.
- **Methods:** KMeans, PCA (for visualization).
- **Data:** `seeds_dataset.txt`

### 2. MAGIC Gamma Classification (`magic_classifier/`)
- **Goal:** Predict whether a particle event is gamma or hadron using classifiers.
- **Methods:** KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks.
- **Extras:** Balanced dataset using oversampling.
- **Data:** `magic04.data`

### 3. Seoul Bike Sharing Prediction (`seoul_bike_regression/`)
- **Goal:** Predict how many bikes will be rented based on weather conditions.
- **Methods:** Linear Regression, Deep Neural Networks (TensorFlow).
- **Data:** `SeoulBikeData.csv`
